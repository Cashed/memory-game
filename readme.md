#Memory Game Lab

You're going to create a Javascript memory game on a subject of your choice(web frameworks, dog breeds, etc.)  See the example gifs at the bottom of the page for inspiration.

###The requirements

* The game must consist of at least 16 cards
* A user can click two cards each turn.  If they are a match, the cards stay overturned.  Otherwise, both cards flip back over.
* A score display that shows how many matches a user has made
* If the user matches all the cards, display a congratulations message
* A reset button which will restart the game and reset the cards
* Style it.  Make it look nice.
* Deploy it to Github Pages.
* Submit the link.

###Bonus Features
* Add a card-flipping animation when the user clicks a card
* Add a time limit.  If the time expires, show the user a game over screen.
